description: |
  Ginkgo is the oldest living species of tree on earth, dating back to the Paleozoic period (more than 225 million years ago). The medicinal use of ginkgo leaf is first mentioned in Chinese medicine in the Ming dynasty in 1436. A standardised extract of ginkgo leaf is one of the most clinically tested and frequently prescribed phytomedicines in Europe, and has been one of the 10 best-selling herbal dietary supplements in the US for about six years.
