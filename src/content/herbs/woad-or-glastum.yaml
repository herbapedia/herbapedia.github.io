  Woad is an ancient plant native to central and western Asia and Russia, but widely cultivated across Europe. Europeans prized it for its blue dye, which has been used to colour clothes and make paint. The first archaeological finds of woad seeds date to the Neolithic period and were discovered in caves in France
