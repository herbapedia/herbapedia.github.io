description: |
  In traditional British herbal-based medicine, garlic was used garlic to treat hoarseness and coughs, both as a syrup and in a salve made of garlic and lard, which was rubbed on the chest and back. Cherokee Indians also used it as an expectorant for coughs and croup. In 1858, Louis Pasteur observed garlic's antibacterial activity, and it was used as an antiseptic to prevent gangrene during World War I and World War II.
