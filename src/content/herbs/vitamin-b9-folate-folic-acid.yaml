description: |
  Folate gets its name from the Latin word "folium" for leaf, as it was first extracted from spinach leaves. It was identified by researcher Lucy Wills nearly 70 years ago as the nutrient needed to prevent the anemia of pregnancy. Dr. Wills demonstrated that the anemia could be corrected by a yeast extract. Folate was identified as the corrective substance in yeast extract in the late 1930s, and was extracted from spinach leaves in 1941.
