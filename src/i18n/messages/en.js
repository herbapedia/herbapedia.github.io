      title: 'History',
      p1: 'Herbapedia was first created in the year 2000 by Vita Green Health Products Ltd and designed by the late Hillman Curtis, when there was no publicly-accessible, medically-curated and accurate set of scientific, herbal knowledge for the public.',
      p2: 'In addition to the over 100 herbal ingredients documented, a key feature of the Herbapedia was its high-quality vector images, entirely drawn from scratch to illustrate to the reader how particular herbal medicine plants look like.',
      p3: 'The Herbapedia was developed and funded by Vita Green and hosted for public consumption since then. As a founding member of the SIPM, Vita Green has given permission to the SIPM to reproduce and expand the data set for open use, and the SIPM is grateful to continue the baton of the Herbapedia.'
